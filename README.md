# MidiSync
This generic Midi file parser was created for synchronizing real-time visual effects to note events in a soundtrack. The typical use-case would be to play an audio stream and simultaneously havind MidiSync fire silent note events to your game or demo engine. This has advantages over spectrum analysis because the note events afford more exact and precize timing and control.
